        <li><strong>40</strong> plain flour</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 tsp</strong> baking powder</li>

    <h2>Recipe:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Separate the egg, putting the white 
            and yolk in separate bowls. 
            Mix the egg yolk with the flour, 
            baking powder and milk to make 
            a smooth paste.
        </li>
        <li>
            eat the egg white and a pinch of salt with an electric whisk 
            <ins>(or by hand)</ins> until fluffy and holding its shape. 
            Gently fold the egg white into the yolk mixture. 
            Be extra careful not to knock any of the air out.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the butter and oil in a non-stick frying pan. 
            Dollop a third of the mixture into the pan and cook 
            on each side for 1-2 mins or until golden brown. 
            Repeat with the remaining mixture to make three pancakes. 
            Drizzle over some maple syrup or honey 
            and serve with berries, <strong><em>if you like.</em></strong>
        </li>
