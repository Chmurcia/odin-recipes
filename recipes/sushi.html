    <h2>Recipe</h2>

        <li>
            KIDS the writing in bold is for you. 
            ADULTS the rest is for you. TO MAKE SUSHI ROLLS:
             Pat out some rice. Lay a nori sheet on the mat,
              shiny-side down. Dip your hands in the 
              vinegared water, then pat handfuls of rice 
              on top in a 1cm thick layer, leaving the 
              furthest edge from you clear.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread over some Japanese mayonnaise. 
            Use a spoon to spread out a thin layer 
            of mayonnaise down the middle of the 
            rice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the filling. Get your child to top 
            the mayonnaise with a line of their 
            favourite fillings - here we've used 
            tuna and cucumber.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll it up. Lift the edge of the mat over 
            the rice, applying a little pressure to keep 
            everything in a tight roll.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stick down the sides like a stamp. 
            When you get to the edge without any rice, 
            brush with a little water and continue to roll 
            into a tight roll.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wrap in cling film. Remove the mat and roll 
            tightly in cling film before a grown-up cuts 
            the sushi into thick slices, then unravel the 
            cling film.
        </li>
        <li>
            TO MAKE PRESSED SUSHI: Layer over some smoked salmon. 
            Line a loaf tin with cling film, then place 
            a thin layer of smoked salmon inside on 
            top of the cling film.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover with rice and press down. Press about 
            3cm of rice over the fish, fold the cling film 
            over and press down as much as you can, using 
            another tin if you have one.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tip it out like a sandcastle. Turn block of sushi
             onto a chopping board. Get a grown-up to cut 
             into fingers, then remove the cling film.
        </li>
        <li>
            TO MAKE SUSHI BALLS: Choose your topping. 
            Get a small square of cling film and place 
            a topping, like half a prawn or a small piece 
            of smoked salmon, on it. Use damp hands to roll 
            walnut-sized balls of rice and place on the topping.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make into tight balls. Bring the corners of the cling film 
            together and tighten into balls by twisting it up, 
            then unwrap and serve.
